    The Hackney Boys were predominantly from the London Fields area Although were close to other 
    <br>
    Hackney Boys on the Pembury and Mothers Square estates. It was not quite a borough wide gang 
    <br>
    but covered the E2/E5/E8 postcodes Operation Trident unit put the start of the war down to 
    <br>
    the killing of Guydance Dacres, 16, who was shot dead in Chimes in January 1997. It occurred 
    <br>
    at a private party when Tottenham Mandem associate Anthony 'Blue' Bourne was alleged to have 
    <br>
    fired a gun at the club which hit and killed Dacres. However, the real ignition is believed 
    <br>
    by many to have been brought on earlier.
<br>
<br>
    In 1995, a couple of youths from Tottenham had been friendly with youths from London Fields 
    <br>
    and Pembury. They went out together robbing people, including young dealers, in other parts 
    <br>
    of north London. They also went on steaming robberies across shops. The Tottenham youths however 
    <br>
    started to come back to Hackney and rerob the Hackney youths which caused very serious grievances.
    <br>
    One of the TMD youths stabbed a Hackney Boy from Pembury in the leg during one of the rerobberies.
    <br>
    An act which led to a series of cyclical violence between the two areas.
    <br>
    <br>
    A couple of TMD youths were confronted by Hackney Boys following this. Which incidentally also 
    <br>
    came a month after the murder of Dacres. The TMD boys were chased but one youth, 'Popcorn' was 
    <br>
    cornered into a block of flats on the Carlton Lodge estate. A small estate around Carlton Road 
    <br>
    just north of Finsbury Park. He was beaten up and then shot dead in the presence of at least six 
    <br>
    members of the Hackney Boys. He bled to death on the roof of a block of flats.
    <br>
<br>
    Popcorn was well known and well connected in the Tottenham area. One TMD youth, and later music 
    <br>
    artist Clint Ponton, helped convict the six suspects from Hackney having also been chased along 
    <br>
    with Popcorn. And whilst a single killer was not identified the suspects were all sentenced at 
    <br>
    the Old Bailey for between four and six years each. It was also alleged Ponton had arranged a 
    <br>
    deal with the seventh suspect who was found not guilty. The Hackney youths were largely from 
    <br>
    London Fields, whilst TMD where largely from Broadwater Farm. Although this conflict is often 
    <br>
    labelled Hackney versus Tottenham. It's really more linked to those two estates within each borough
    <br>
    The series of killings and reprisals between the two areas really kicked off in the late 1990's

    <br>
    Although this conflict is often labelled Hackney versus Tottenham. It's really more linked to those 
    <br>
    two estates within each borough. The series of killings and reprisals between the two areas really 
    <br>
    kicked off in the late 1990's. Two of those convicted for the murder of Popcorn were shot dead by TMD
    <br>
    Soon after their release from prison in separate incidents
    <br>
<br>
    In June 1999, Meneliek Robinson, 20, was driving his red BMW convertible in Hackney. When it was 
    <br>
    followed by two motorbikes. One pulled infront of the BMW, lurking its way, whilst another stopped 
    <br>
    beside it. The pillion dismounted and walked up to the side window firing several shots.
    <br>
<br>
    Two years later in April 2001, another of the Hackney boys convicted. Corey Wright, 20, was also 
    <br>
    shot dead in his car in Hackney. His friend who was with him, Wayne Henry, was also killed. The 
    <br>
    shots fired into Wright's BMW, caused the vehicle to lose control. And it went off the road into 
    <br>
    a bus stop by Thistlethwaite Road in Lower Clapton. These were some of the 8 gang and organised 
    <br>
    crime related killings that earned Lower and Upper Clapton Road the reputation as 'Murder Mile'
    <br>
<br>
    Although the murders were never solved, some people believe Clint Ponton had some involvement.
    <br>
    And it is alleged he contacted the Hackney Boys to deny his involvement a couple of days after 
    <br>
    the murders of Wright and Henry. Hackney responded with the murder of TMD / Firm member 'Buckhead' 
    <br>
    Crawford from Edmonton. He was murdered in December 2002 after being shot down in a hail of bullets 
    <br>
    in front of his girlfriend in West Green Road, Tottenham. Hackney Boy Daniel 'DC' Cummings, who was 
    <br>
    also a Hounslow club promoter, was pinned with the murder having been identified by witnesses
    <br>
<br>
    However, Clint Ponton again comes into the frame according to street legends. They go along the lines 
    <br>
    that DC was not behind the killing but Clint Ponton had forced Crawford's girlfriend to identify Cummings
    <br>
    A strategic move of sorts. DC has been serving a life sentence since 2003. A series of events following Buckhead's 
    <br>
    murder led to the eventual death of Hackney boy Jason Fearon. It happened at Turnmills Club in Clerkenwell during a So Solid 
    <br>
    Crew event. Who were managed by Tottenham mandem's later Northstar team. Where singer Lisa Maffia was to be promoting her debut single
    <br>
    An anonymous tip-off was made to Crimestoppers that there would be trouble at the event, and there was an attempt to prevent the event going 
    <br>
    ahead, but the event organiser refused. As a result, the police parked a vehicle outside the club hoping that it would deter any would-be gunmen. However, 
    <br>
    in the early hours, several men burst into the nightclub firing shots, injuring one person. The gunfire continued as the targets were chased into the street. Jason 
    <br>
    Fearon and another man, who believe was the main target, made away in an Audi TT sports car. They were followed by the two Tottenham men, who police believed to be Clint Ponton 
    <br>
    and Wes Lambie, firing shots into the Audi from their BMW during a car chase. Fearon, who was wearing a bulletproof vest, was hit in the head and died. Clint Ponton, also known as C1 or 
    <br> 
    The Chosen One, and Wes Lambie went into the music industry. Forming the label Northstar, whilst with the Tottenham mandem. Meanwhile, in the background to these seven killings, Mark Lambie had become a target of the 
    <br>
    recently formed Metropolitan Police unit 
    <br>
    <br>
    Operation Trident
